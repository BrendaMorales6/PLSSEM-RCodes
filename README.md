# Structural equation model code analysed with partial least squares

This repository contains the RStudio code employed for the analysis of Structural Equation Modelling using Partial Least Squares, applied to a Theory of Planned behaviour survey.  The code has been developed specifically for this study and allows for the replication of the results published at (Springer Nature?).
The main R library is "plspm".
