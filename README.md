# Structural equation model code analysed with partial least squares and mixed logit models

This repository contains the RStudio code employed for the analysis of Structural Equation Modelling using Partial Least Squares, applied to a Theory of Planned behaviour survey, as well as the loop develop to stabilise tha analisys ofd a Discrete Choice Experiment using mixed logit models.  The code has been developed specifically for this study and allows for the replication of the results published at (Springer Nature?).
The main R library employed for the PLS analysis is "plspm".
